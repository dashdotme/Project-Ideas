# Task Decomposer

Parses a given md file into a 'module' ie. a folder, where each # heading is stored separately. 

Inject all tags, along with the foldername, and a way to traverse between.

Modify the original file to be composed of links to each subfile, but otherwise look the same.


### Why?
Purpose here is to make notes more reusable and composable elsewhere, just like you do with code.
