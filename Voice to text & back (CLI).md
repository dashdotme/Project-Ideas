## Review 
This has been done quite widely in the browser, though not with any reasonable UX. 

After playing with (free) voice-to-text solutions, this isn't appealing. Typing is better.

The idea of 'speaking' one query while working on another problem is appealing, but it implies you're doing two very easy things. No real productivity gain here, just a lot of extra compute and potential cleanup of voice-to-text.
