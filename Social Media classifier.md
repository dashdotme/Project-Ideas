# Social Media classifier
Setup browser plug-in:
- parse page into gpt3 (chatgpt fine-tuning won't improve classification)
- simple 0-4 classifier, bad to good
- markup to render that as a coloured icon
- extend to optimize what is passed to gpt (data cleanup)
- extend to support more sites (start with reddit)
